      <h1>Description</h1>
      <p>
        Data can be scary. It can point to numerous flaws and mistakes of
        humanity. But data is humane! So aside from graphics and probabilities,
        data can be beautiful. It can teach something about The Other or about
        yourself. Starting from that point, I decided to humanize my data by
        keeping track of multiple habits for an entire week. Those were routine
        habits associated with my feelings - read stress and joy - in one way or
        another. For instance, I was tracking the amount of entertainment I
        consume daily. That's because when I'm happy and relaxed, I tend to
        watch more movies and play video games. When I'm sad or anxious, I only
        listen to music or watch something shorter. After collecting enough
        data, I translated the possible outcomes in a visual representation to
        create a data-self portrait for each day.

      <p>
        My data portrait is assembled by the following outputs...
        <li>1. My overall sentiment for that day.</li>
        <li>2. If my husband had somehow annoyed me or not.</li>
        <li>
          3. My water intake - since I tend to drink less water (and take less
          care of myself) when I'm in stressed or busy.
        </li>
        <li>4. The people - from my homecountry - that I talked to, if any.</li>
        <li>5. If I consumed any form of entretainment that day.</li>
        <li>6. The places I'd been that day.</li>
        <li>
          7. Last but not least, how many times I'd regreted doing something
          that day - could be eating too many sweets, shopping unnecessary stuff
          or itching too much.
        </li>

      <!--What did you learn about yourself through the process of self-tracking?
What was gained / lost through the process of data visualization? -->
      <h1>Reflection</h1>
      <p>
        The process of self-tracking gave me not only insights about myself but
        about data as a whole. I was able to realize how anxious I am yet, how
        hard - meaning close to impossible - is to track and expose my anxiety
        behavior through meaningful and precise data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through this project, I was also able to realize how data is a very
        delicate object to work with. For instance, I was keeping track of my
        water intake. I decided to do that specifically because, for the past
        few weeks, I was drinking very little water. About 1 liter a day - which
        is terrible. However, once I decided to track my intake, I started to
        drink more water! In the end, to some extend, I felt like I was
        biasing/corrupting my data. For an external eye, it will look like I
        drink water regularly, but in the long run, I know that don't. The data
        was just forcing me to behave differently.
