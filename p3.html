      <h1>Description</h1>
      <p>
        Conventional clocks mark time according to a standardized 24 hour cycle.
        This approach, however, is not universal in terms of capturing and
        measuring of experience. So this project was developed to show time in a
        way that orginary clocks fail. The clocks you see here are personal and
        subjective. They are directly related to my own perception of time.
      </p>

      <h1>Design Process</h1>
      <p>
        I'd started my process by reading and reflecting about our relation with
        time. I checked dictionaries, myths and I thought about our mannerisms
        while talking about time. So my first idea came out of how we report
        time to others. If it's 8:37:46, we will often say 8:30 (eight thirty).
        In that sense, I would illustrate time as fading. Minutes and seconds
        would stay behind hours. Different opacities for different weights.
      </p>

      <div class="fullwidth">
        <img
          width="600px"
          height="400px"
          src="https://cdn.glitch.com/7f1f4efb-bcb9-43ca-942f-803f8367ea0e%2FclockOne.jpg?v=1632274751424"
        />
      </div>

      <p>
        But I came up with a few questions that I wanted to ruminate on... Why
        do we think time goes by differently at certain occasions? Why/When do
        say that we hate it? Why/When do we love it? Why/When we don't want to
        forget it? That sparked a memory of a curious object that I saw in books
        and movies from the Harry Potter saga.
      </p>

      "A Remembrall is a magical large marble-sized glass ball that contains
      smoke which turns red when its owner or user has forgotten something. It
      turns clear once whatever was forgotten is remembered."

      <p>
        The idea here would be to convert that object into a time object. You
        would shake a glass ball to make the time appear and then shake again to
        make it dissapear. Cause sometimes we just want to forget about time
        anyway...
      </p>

      <div class="fullwidth">
        <img
          width="600px"
          height="400px"
          src="https://cdn.glitch.com/7f1f4efb-bcb9-43ca-942f-803f8367ea0e%2FclockTwo.jpg?v=1632274756121"
        />
      </div>

      <p>
        Then I had my last and favorite idea... Starting from the idea of how I
        perceived time differently depending on what I am doing... what I am
        thinking. Each clock has a different disturbance. A variable that I've
        created as a way to translate/mesasure how much certain events in my
        life annoy me/make me anxious.
      </p>

      <div class="fullwidth">
        <img
          width="600px"
          height="400px"
          src="https://cdn.glitch.com/7f1f4efb-bcb9-43ca-942f-803f8367ea0e%2FclockThree.jpg?v=1632274758473"
        />
      </div>

      <p>
        One of the clocks - the one in the middle, would be just like any other
        clock. It would perceive time like I wish that I perceived time. Hours,
        minutes and seconds. Then, by moving the mouse, I would had many other
        clocks bringing up questions related to my life and its conundrums...
      </p>
      <p>
        "Did you finish your assignment?","Wheres is your visa?" Those are the
        clocks that disturb me the most. One is fast and wobbly. So many things
        to do... So little time... The other clock goes backwards. Also, shaky.
        After being in a immigration process for so long, sometimes it feels
        like it's never going to happen. Like it gets more distant every day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, my last two clocks. "When are you going to visit your grandma?"
        and "When will you be ok?" Both questions used to trouble me a lot a
        while ago. But I notice how I don't get as much disturbed like used to.
        I've learned that missing my family is part of the process of building a
        new life somewhere. I've that I AM OK. I've been ok since the beginning
        and I'll continue to be.
      </p>

      <h1>Reflection</h1>
      <p>
        Time is a curse and a medicine. It makes us look at problems through a
        different lense, depending on the occasion. It tranforms one in pure
        anxiety and it brings confort to others. It's equal and it's not. It's a
        exact system but it's a system inserted within a social one, which is
        not exact at all.
      </p>
