      <h1>Description</h1>

      <p>
        Gaining access to the userâ€™s webcam is a sensitive topic and should be
        dealt with care, because capturing is a form of seeing, and seeing can
        either empower or disempower the user in front of the webcam.
      </p>

      <h1>Design Process</h1>
      <p>
        Using my Camera-Pong game from project #8 I wanted to further the idea of the camera filter.
        Not everyone is comfortable with their self-image and I wanted the game to be fun, not to cause discomfort. 
        However, it could be fun to allow people to see themselves in the camera, 
        since the act of moving around in two axis to try to control two paddles can make the user 
        to move in an odd and funny way.
        For that, I created a initial flowchart that would explain the game, its rules, and handle the control
        - of the game and of the camera - to its user. So they can decide what they want to see and what experience
        they want to have.
      </p>

      <h1>Reflection</h1>
      <p>
        If we design a non-intrusive interfaces we can guarantee that our experience will be delivered at its best.
        We can even empower our user and make everyone more comportable. There are a few pervasive practices in design
        and indutrustry patterns that are not questioned/challenged enough. We should keep looking for responsive design practices,
        one that respects people's boundaries and modulate its software to provide a good experience for all.
