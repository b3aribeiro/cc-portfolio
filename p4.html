      <h1>Description</h1>
      <p>
        Exquisite corpse is a surrealist technique to create surprising 
        and unexpected forms of narratives. It's a collaboration between
        multiple people to sew a exquisite and oddly delightful figure.

      <h1>Design Process</h1>
      <p>
        As the Exquisite Corpse process demands, we began by drawing our creatures/beings on our own.
        No interference or constraints. No references. 
        We could design whatever we wanted. The result was the following:
      </p>
      <div class="fullwidth"> 
        <img width="600px" height="300px"
          src="https://cdn.glitch.com/7f1f4efb-bcb9-43ca-942f-803f8367ea0e%2FA4-alldrawings.jpg?v=1632890284343"/>
        <li> The Dragon, from Beatriz (myself)
        
        </li>
        <li> The Lizard, from Myles
        <li> Their name is Daniel and they are hopelessly in love with the idea of rainy days, but unfortunately they live in Arizona. Optimistic as ever, Daniel dons a rain jacket and boots every day in hopes of manifesting the perfect rainy day</li>
        </li>
        <li> The Robot, from Lynette
      <li> My robot is drew based on my favorite kitchen supplies, which have been my best friends since the quarantine time.
      </li></li>
      </div>
      <p>
        We then made up rules to exchange our three parts - head, body, and bottom. 
        Each of us would keep our own head - which is good, isn't it? tsc - and s
        wap our corpse's body and bottom with one another. 
        I ended up with Myles' body and Lynette's, 
        while each of them got the same part of my corpse.
      </p>
       <div class="fullwidth"> 
         <img width="300px" height="500px"
          src="https://cdn.glitch.com/7f1f4efb-bcb9-43ca-942f-803f8367ea0e%2FA4-shouldlooklike.JPG?v=1632890286797"/>
      </div>
      <p>
        Later, starting with our own remained part (head) we would re-create our own interpretation 
        of that exquisite being. In order to better visualize this, 
        I went to editing software and made a clumsy collage. 
        The challenge I've found here was to understand who could I reinterpreted 
        those detail and way different styles within my own.
      </p>
      
      
      <!-- 5. reflection -->
      <h1>Reflection</h1>
      <p>
        While creating this being, I've noticed many dissonances between 
        the original pieces and final one. From color palette to angle to contour to each style itself. 
        The difficulty I've found was not in coding, but in translating those details 
        without losing the personality I was seeing in the originals 
        or even without interfering on my own style.
      </p></p>
        So it's interesting to me how difficult it is to translate and unify parts in
        order to create a whole. Simplification or complexization of figures is a field
        to be addressed with more time and through practice. Abstracting something that 
        it's not clear in your mind is a damanding challenge. So is the understading of
        your own style and visual signature - or lacking of it.

        Critical Computation (2021) Assignment #4</a>. The green lizard/dragon creature is was designed by Myles House,
