      <h1>Description</h1>
      <p>
        The project above was an experiment in parameterized design where I've
        tried to create multiple variations of the same form by using multiple
        shapes and setting constraints to those varieties. This project also
        question what defines certain figures, like a face. What are the
        constraints that make those shapes recognizable?
      </p>

      <h1>Design Process</h1>
      <p>
        From the beginning, I wanted to do something more abstract. So instead
        of starting by drawing precise versions of my face, I simply defined,
        broadly, how far (or how close) each component of my random face could
        go while still being considered a face.
      </p>
      <div class="fullwidth">
        <img
          src="https://cdn.glitch.com/7f1f4efb-bcb9-43ca-942f-803f8367ea0e%2Frandomprocess.png?v=1631663593723"
        />
      </div>
      <p>
        From that point, I started to think about each component separately.
        "What sorts of shapes can be read as an eye?", "What can I draw noses?",
        "How can I simplify a mouth?". I kept questioning those things and then
        I decided between a couple of elements to randomize on each part of my
        randomized face.
      </p>
      <div class="fullwidth">
        <img
          src="https://cdn.glitch.com/7f1f4efb-bcb9-43ca-942f-803f8367ea0e%2Fgoodrandom.JPG?v=1631391311048"
        />
        "What is a face?"
      </div>
      <p>
        Finally, I began to think in different ways to interact with my figure
        in order to randomize it. I choose to create some variations according
        to which part of the screen the user decided to click. For instance, the
        main shape changes according to the side of the screen. Also, the smile
        will vary according to height. From smiley to neutral to sad.
      </p>

      <h1>Reflection</h1>
      <p>
        It's easy to find yourself so focused on the parameters and numbers and
        conditions that you simply forget about what is that you're doing. What
        kind of exceptions your object needs? Are you including everything that
        is necessary to build that system?
