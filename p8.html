      <h1>Description</h1>
      
      <p>
      Conventional cameras imitate the resolution, depth of field, and color range of the human eyes. 
      For this prototype, make sure you have good light so your face is visible. 
      Show your little nose to the camera and use it to control both paddles.
      Left paddle is controled by moving your nose through the X-axis, while
      Right paddle is controld by moving your nose through the Y-axis. 
      Battle against yourself and have fun. 
      </p>

      <h1>Design Process</h1>
      <p>
      I'm often have issues with my self-image, or better saying, my self-digital image. 
      While it's no big deal to look at myself in a mirror, it causes me discomfort 
      to look at my flipped image on a camera. That being said, I wanted my experimental camera 
      to create a space where one can be playful and comfortable, without exposing themselves. 
      I also wanted to play with clmtrkr.js library so... :) I began sketching ideas where I could make use of that tool.
      </p>

         <img width="600px" height="400px"

      </div>
      
      <p>
        IDEA 1: Blinkin' n' Jumpin' —> running game like the google dinosaur, but you control jumps through blinking. 
        But blinking seemed to be a problem between some of my colleagues, so that made me rethink this idea.
      </p>
      <p>
        IDEA 2: Pong versus yourself —> You control both padles by moving your face through x and y axis. 
      </p>
      <p>
        IDEA 3: Pong multiplayer —> Each player controls one paddle with their face. They compete to score more points. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
       Once I'd decided on my idea (2) I began my prototyping. I took Shiffman's Pong Challenge 
        and removed its controls so I could add the clmtrkr.js library.
        I wanted to detect someone's movement so that person could control both paddles.
        Initially, I thought about using right and left hand, like a battle of dextrity between your hands.
        Then I realized the game experience would be more interesting if I made if more clumsy.
        To that end, changed the movemnt to the user's nose, so one would need to move
        awkwardly around the screen, between W and Y axis.

      <h1>Reflection</h1>
      <p>
      Through this process, I've learned not only the technicalities of receiving, 
        decoding and coding through the use of someone's image, but it also made me 
        question how intrusive applications might be. Function hide(), for instance, 
        made me think a lot about consent, especially because my user might not truly 
        understand how and I'm using their image and "allow camera" button doesn't expose 
        that.  For future iterations, I could create a boarding interaction, explaining 
        to my user how am designing controls and asking how comfortable they feel 
        about seeing/exposing their image, giving them the control on how clear the 
        camera image has to be.
