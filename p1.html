      <h1>Description</h1>
      <p>
        This project explores the ambiguity in human language as well as the gap
        between human language and computer language. The figure above
        represents someone's lost object, a personal item still alive as memory.
      </p>

      <h1>Design Process</h1>
      <p>
        I began my process with a shy sketch on a post-it, not really as a form
        of visualizing the object, but instead, a way to materialize my
        thoughts. The description I had was simple...
      </p>
      <div class="fullwidth">
        <p>
          "My lost object is used to capture memories. It was black and silver.
          It was an analog piece of technology. It used film and the product of
          its captures had to be processed manually before one could see what
          came out of it. It was an object commonly used by families and
          professionals alike. The bulk of its build was metal to ensure it was
          durable enough to withstand relatively harsh conditions or
          shortfalls."
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Here's where my vision own vision of the meaning of a camera, mixes with
        the description... I see those objects as powerful memory instruments.
        Knowing a bit about my colleague, my goal then was to transform that
        sketch into something personal and intimate. Then I decided to make the
        sketch interactive. How? By loading random pictures of landscapes and
        such between the image of the object. With a click, you can not only
        find the lost object but see some of the memories attached to that
        object. Or at least that I was the intention. That way, our traveler
        friend, Wafi - who gave us the description of the Lost Object - can
        travel again.
      </p>

      <h1>Reflection</h1>
      <p>
        There's an obvious gap between human language and code language. That
        gap will be even more noticeable depending on who's communicating.
        Still, what surprises me the most is the gap between our thoughts and
        the physical and/or technical language. Objects might seem clear in our
        minds but a simple transposition to a paper, or any other physical (or
        digital medium), makes us realize how little we know about what
        surrounds us. It's also curious to me our patterns while communicating
        ideas that have emotional meaning to us. We tend to describe those
        objects using sort of a passionate description, even when technical
        voice would lead us to a better result. To illustrate, we may consider
        the many versions of analog cameras out there. Their lenses might be in
        the middle of the camera body, exposed; or they can be positioned
        slightly to the right/left. There's also the possibility of that lens
        being covered. Buttons might be positioned differently. Their different
        materials, textures, colors... No matter what's the case, when we try to
        describe, those details often go unnoticed.
