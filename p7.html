      <h1>Description</h1>

      <p>
        Every one of us has a story, a narrative that we either tell to
        ourselves or others, about who we are. This narrative tells a story of a
        ghost who lives between two worlds. Everything the ghost does reminds it
        of the burden of not fitting the binary. Ghost loves humans, other
        ghosts and other creatures who live in between too. But not everyone
        understands. Ghost speaks human and ghost language. So sometimes is
        stressful to deal with a messy brain it is. Ghost likes numbers and
        exact things. But ghost also likes to talk about things of beings. Ghost
        is multi. Multi ethnic, multi cultured, multi liguistic. Ghost sometimes
        is so "in between" that it feels unseen... Outcasted. Could Ghost be
        considered a shapeshipfter? Or just someone who's is all, not one? One
        who is learning how to live between two worlds.

      <h1>Design Process</h1>
      <p>
        I'm biracial, bisexual, bilingual. My ancetors came from two different
        continents. I grew up in a world of "twos." Poor neighborhood, but had
        access to many different opportunities. Catholic, then Buddhist, then
        both, then none. I love the exact sciences. But I also love to study
        human condition. All that (and more) took me to a simple mechanic of
        "shapeshifting". Changing colors. Facing the world through
        different/multiple lenses. Which makes me change... Constantly...

      <h1>Reflection</h1>
      <p>
        Building this game revealed to me the pros and cons of abstraction. I
        had to abstract facts of my own live into mechanics. That way I could
        have a system simple enough gamify and program. However, this made me
        discard several details, to the point that the essence of my story was
        no longer clear - at least not as I wish it was.
