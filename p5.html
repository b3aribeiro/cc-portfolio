      <h1>Description</h1>
      <p>
        Pattern-making is an ancient and culturally diverse practice. For this
        project, I decided to look back a popular pattern of the Brazilian
        culture. Then, to use reproduce the pattern in the digital form, while
        creating an optical illusion.
      </p>

      <h1>Design Process</h1>
      <p>
        When we (Brazilians) think about Copacabana, in Rio de Janeiro, this
        pattern comes to our minds almost instantly. Supposedly, it represents
        an harmonious encounter of the beach and the city. Harmonious... If we
        ignore the pollution that has been plaguing some areas. In spite of
        that, the pattern became a signature of the shore and it's design is
        made out of white calcite and black basalt from Portugal, our beloved
        Colonizers ((contain irony)). In fact, the pattern is very common
        between lusophone countries. Although most Brazilians think it is unique
        and exclusive from their country, the route is actually based on Praça
        do Rocio, in Lisbon.

        />
      </div>
      <p>
        So I decided to design a new interpretation of this iconic and dubious
        pattern. Thanks to Plural Artes video (see credits), I was able to break
        down the pattern. At first I thoght about translating it to full
        circles, but after soe failures, I realized that would need to work with
        half circles - aka arcs - to reach the combination I wanted.
      </p>

      <!-- What are some impacts and effects of translating the pattern of your choice into digital, animating form?
How does creating an optical illusion recontexualizes how the pattern was traditionally used & understood?
-->
      <h1>Reflection</h1>
      <p>
        The most difficult part of the creation was to understand the process
        behind the pattern. How to retro-enginner it? What kind of primitive
        shapes we can encounter within it? What is the frequency each shape is
        repeated? How do I represent that in the code? In that sense, modules
        became my best friends. Once I figured out how to break that pattern in
        pieces, it became more natural to assemble it all again.
